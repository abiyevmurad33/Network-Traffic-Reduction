# Scenarios

This folder contains scenario files used for experiments.

- asic.wad is sourced from the upstream ViZDoom repository (default scenarios).
- asic_movement.cfg is maintained in this thesis repository.

Important:
- The base asset IWAD reedoom2.wad (or doom2.wad) is required to run scenarios.
- IWAD files are NOT committed to Git due to size/licensing considerations.
